# Overview

This interface layer handles the communication between any service and a service that
provides monitoring facilities (eg Ganglia).


# Usage

## Requires

Charms in need of an access to a monitoring service require this interface.

This interface layer will set the following state, as appropriate:

  * `{relation_name}.available`   The relation to the monitoring service has been
    established. The charm can retrieve the IP of the monitorin service through a call to:
    * `endpoint()`.

For example, let's say that a charm wants to use the monitoring service. The charm should
specify the relation through which the monitoring service is becoming available, in this case
we call this relation ``ganglia''.

```python
@when('ganlia.available')
def setup_monitoring(ganglia):
    ip = ganglia.endpoint()
```

## Provides

A charm providing monitoring services should implement this interface.

As soon as a `monitor` relation is established the `{relation_name}.available` state is set.
The service provider can use the configure method to populate the `hostname` relation data variable.
If the `hostname` data variable is not set the consumer of the monitor service will fall back to use the
`private_address` of the relation.
